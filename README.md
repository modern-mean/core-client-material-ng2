# core-client-material-ng2
This is currently a WORK IN PROGRESS.

# Notice
* This package does not currently run with the modern-mean server or build procedures.  It is meant as a standalone app to start developing on ng2.  We will work to get this module working with the server packages when the standalone app is complete.
* Material2 is severely lacking in features right now.  We will continue to work on this repo as they add additional functionality.

git clone https://github.com/modern-mean/core-client-material-ng2.git modern-mean-core-client-material-ng2

#Development
